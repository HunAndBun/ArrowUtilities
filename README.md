# Introduction
ArrowUtilities is a kitchen-sink style Unity class library aimed at adding game development tools to solve common issues faced during the architectural stages of game projects. Born out of my frustrations with Unity's Vector struct in C#, the project expanded to include many more tools once that issue was taken care of. Everything from syntactically-sugary RNG methods, to helper functions for runtime tilemap editing.

# Features

### Serialization
Anyone who has attempted to serialize the Vector family of Structs in the UnityEngine namespace, even with robust serializing tools like Newtonsoft.Json, has probably run into this issue: 
<br/> ![FVwBaL6XoAAeiRF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26573464/175223683-25b21efd-63b3-4e68-a642-87ad454b4adc.png)
<br/>With ArrowUtilities, this is a simple fix.

```C#
var myVector = new Vector2(0f,0f);
//Time to serialize!
var serializableForm = myVector.ToSerializable();
```

This converts the standard Unity Vector2 struct to a Vector2Serializable struct, containing only the needed data, and a
method to quickly change it back.

```C#
var unityVersionOnceAgain = serializableForm.ToVector2();
```

Needless to say, this functionality is available for Vector2, Vector2Int, Vector3, Vector3Int, and Vector4.<br/>
If needed, you can of-course construct these directly. [You can read more about this system here!](https://github.com/HunAndBun/ArrowUtilities/wiki/(Struct)-SerializableVectorStructs)

### Randomness
Pseudo-Random mechanics are by no-means difficult to program. However, you may find yourself making lots of helper
functions to cut down on how often you're typing `if (Random.Value > 0.5f)` etc.. ArrowUtilities aims to make these
mechanics both quicker to code, and with clearly baked-intent. Here's a quick list of the available methods:

```C#
//Note: All 'RNG' methods are static. No need to declare a 'new' RNG.
RNG.Chance(0.3f); //The float parameter can be treated as a percentage chance. 0.3f is 30% chance, etc.. Returns a boolean. 
RNG.FiftyFifty(); //Simple 50/50 chance. Returns a boolean. 
RNG.DiceRoll(5) //Takes in a number of 'sides' for the die. Returns an int from 1 to the number of sides.
RNG.D6(); //Preset version of DiceRoll() with 6 sides. Standard D4, D6, D10, D12, and D20 are all implemented. 
RNG.GetReferenceToRandom(); //Returns a static instance of System.Random, instantiated the first time you call it. 
//For Enumerables. All methods are generic extensions that may be called directly using the dot operator.
myList.Randomize(); //Short-hand for "myList.OrderBy(_ => RNG.GetReferenceToRandom.Next());"
myList.GetRandomEntry(); //Short-hand for "myList.OrderBy(_ => RNG.GetReferenceToRandom().Next()).First()"
```

### Tilemaps
Whether you're making a rogue-like with fully procedural floors, or a game where the user draws, you probably know just how annoying it can be to place tiles at runtime. Single tiles are easy, but when you begin placing many at a time, the code probably got pretty long. You need a BoundsInt for the full area you're placing tiles in, a TileBase array filled with precisely the correct number of tiles to fill that area, and enough caffeine to stay awake throughout the process of trying to make it even semi-performant. 
<br/>ArrowUtilities has you covered. As of now, you can draw large squares simply by using the following code:

```C#
myTilemap.SetSquareOfTiles(myVector3Int, 10, myTile); 
//The Vector3Int determines the bottom left corner, and the 10 is the size-per-side.
```

The best part is, the TileBase array is cached, so if you only change the location you're drawing and keep the tile and size the same, you'll save on a likely very large iterator call! [You can read more about it here!](https://github.com/HunAndBun/ArrowUtilities/wiki/(Class)-TileHelpers)

### Misc
Arrow Utilities has some other offerings worth taking a look at, specifically in the debugging and optimization departments. For example, check out this cool debug log block! [You can read more about it here!](https://github.com/HunAndBun/ArrowUtilities/wiki/(Class)-BetterDebug)
