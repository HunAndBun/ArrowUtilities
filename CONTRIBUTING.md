### Purpose of Arrow Utilities
When contributing to Arrow Utilities, it's important to know what it sets out to do. The following is a list of what exactly that is.
<br/><br/><b>‚úîÔ∏è Arrow Utilities DOES:</b>
- Target game development in Unity Engine.
- Provide general-purpose... 
  - static classes, 
  - structs, 
  - extention methods,
  - and syntactically sugary methods.
- Provide tools for all programming skill levels.
- Treat itself as a kitchen-sink library with variety, no outright focus.
- Give the user full control of what they're using.

<b>‚ùå Arrow Utilities DOESN'T:</b>
- Aim to be functional OUTSIDE of Unity Engine.
- Provide tools for SPECIFIC types of games. (example: RPG item base classes.)
- Provide background-functions that aren't within the user's direct control.

### Suggestions
Suggestions for Arrow Utilities are handled through [github's issue system](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). We do understand that some folks might be hesitant to make an issue if they think their suggestion isn't big enough, important enough, or worthwhile. We'd never judge you like that üò§ but if you want a more "light-weight" way of suggesting to ease some of that anxiety, feel free to drop into [Our Discord]() and run it by us!

<b>Here are a few of the key components to a high-quality suggestion:</b>
- General:
  - Give a short, descriptive title. Let us know what you're suggesting without typing the whole thing twice. 
- For new features:
  - Describe the problem to solve / improvement broadly.
  - Give a more specific example of your feature being used.
  - If applicable, give a `code block` of what would be required to achieve the same effect WITHOUT your feature.
- For changing a feature:
  - List the specific feature you want to upgrade.
  - Describe what isn't currently possible / ideal with the implmentation.
  - If applicable, write a `code block` to show what the implementation SHOULD look like in contrast to it's current state.

### Issues and Bugs

<b>Here are a few of the key components to a high-quality issue report:</b>
- Check the existing issue list! You might not be alone.
- Let us know what happened! The more details the better.
  - What was the context of the feature's usage?
  - Does it happen every time?
  - If it's a crash, include the log.
- What are the steps to reproduce the issue?
  - Make liberal use of the `code block` feature to show exactly how to make it happen again
  - If it's REALLY specific to your use-case, include whatever media you can to show it happening. (videos, images, or your own code)
- How do YOU suggest fixing it? Arrow Utils. is made by programmers FOR programmers, so feel free to chime in!
- ANY other info that you're willing to share, and you believe is important.
  - System specs, project files, Unity version, IDE, etc..
